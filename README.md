# Model Predictive Path Integral Control with Learned Dynamics
Final Project for 16-711 Robot Kinematics, Dynamics, and Control

### Abstract
Optimal control of robotic systems with non-linear dynamics and complex objective functions remains a challenging yet fundamental area of robotics research. We present a nonlinear Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme for systems with unknown or complex dynamics by way of a neural dynamics model. Through the use of a Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) controller and sampling-based action sequence optimization, we demonstrate that neural network dynamics models can be substituted into traditional MPC schemes and achieve high performance in cost minimization. In addition, we show that neural networks can be used both within controllers as forward dynamics models as well as exterior to controllers as inverse dynamics models.
